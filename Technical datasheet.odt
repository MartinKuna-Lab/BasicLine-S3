Technical Datasheet – BasicLine S3 Industrial v1.3.0
Document version: October 2025
Author: Martin Kuna
Firmware compatible with: LILYGO T-Relay S3 Rev 1.1

1. General Information
BasicLine S3 – Industrial is a compact controller designed for automatic management of compressor coolers, fan arrays, and other industrial cooling systems.
The unit is based on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller with extended Flash and PSRAM memory and includes integrated Wi-Fi for local web control, data logging, and service diagnostics.

2. Main Features
Controls up to 6 fans (4 onboard relays + 2 via I?C CHAIN)
Automatic cascade cooling control according to outlet temperature
Reverse cycle after compressor start for fin cleaning
Spray cooling with temperature-based activation
Fan rotation for balanced wear
Service timer with notification after 1000 operating hours
Real-time Cooling Efficiency and Thermal Health Score monitoring
Optional Power Monitor for electrical power measurement
Integrated Web interface with JSON API and EEPROM configuration storage
SD card logging for temperature and system data
Built-in 10 s watchdog for stable 24/7 operation
