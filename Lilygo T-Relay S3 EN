Manufacturer: LilyGO (Shenzhen Xin Yuan Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.)
Platform: ESP32-S3 (Dual-core Xtensa LX7)
Board Revision: Rev 1.1
Release Year: 2023

1. General Overview

The LILYGO T-Relay S3 is a development and control board based on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller with 16 MB Flash and 8 MB PSRAM.
It is designed for applications requiring control of multiple relays, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity, and simultaneous operation with peripherals such as sensors, SD card, RTC, or LCD display.

The board integrates 6 relay channels driven by a 74HC595 shift register, as well as I²C, SPI, UART, 1-Wire, and optional CHAIN I²C expander support for external modules.

4. Relay Architecture

The six relays are controlled serially via a 74HC595 shift register:

Data, Clock, and Latch pins are connected to ESP32-S3 GPIOs.

Relay coils are powered by an independent 12 V circuit, isolated from logic voltage.

Each relay has an onboard LED status indicator.

This design minimizes GPIO usage and allows expansion through the CHAIN I²C interface, where additional relay modules can be connected in sequence.

5. Expansion Options

CHAIN (I²C) port – connect up to 3 additional expansion modules (relay or MOSFET boards).

Power Monitor / ADC – measure voltage or current via INA219 or ACS758.

External Display (ST7789/ST7735) – for system visualization or HMI functions.

SD Card – logging of operational data and errors.

RTC DS3231 – for precise time-stamped logging.

External watchdog or opto-isolated inputs – for safety-critical systems.

6. Use in the BasicLine Project

The T-Relay S3 Rev 1.1 board serves as the primary hardware platform for the BasicLine S3 – Industrial controller.
It provides:

direct connection of 3 × DS18B20 sensors,

control of fans, spray circuit, and reverse operation,

expansion via CHAIN interface,

data display on the integrated LCD,

full control via Wi-Fi and JSON web interface.

7. Installation Recommendations

Supply the board from a stable 12 V DC source (min. 2 A).

Isolate high-voltage outputs from logic signals.

Use shielded cables for DS18B20 and I²C lines in industrial environments.

Format SD cards as FAT32 before use.

For inductive loads, use RC snubbers or varistors on relay outputs.

8. Summary

The LILYGO T-Relay S3 Rev 1.1 is a reliable and versatile platform for industrial and automation projects.
Combining a powerful ESP32-S3 processor, integrated relay module, and multiple interface options, it provides an excellent foundation for:

intelligent cooling controllers,

heating systems,

automation and control units,

monitoring or test equipment.
