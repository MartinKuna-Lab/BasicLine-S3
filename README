BasicLine S3 – Intelligent Cooling Controller

BasicLine S3 is a compact and modular controller based on the ESP32-S3 platform.
It is designed for intelligent cooling, fan regulation, and industrial heat-exchange management.
The system continuously monitors temperature, pressure, and current sensors to optimize performance, efficiency, and safety in demanding environments.

🔧 Key Features

Dual-core ESP32-S3 MCU with Wi-Fi and Modbus-TCP communication

Multi-fan PWM control with adaptive ΔT-based logic

Support for DS18B20, PT100/PT1000, and pressure sensors

Built-in diagnostics, fault detection, and watchdog protection

Fully configurable via serial console or future HMI interface

Compact footprint, suitable for embedded or OEM applications

⚙️ Build & Upload

The firmware is developed using PlatformIO (Arduino framework).

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/BasicLine_S3.git
cd BasicLine_S3

# Build project
pio run

# Upload firmware to ESP32-S3
pio run --target upload


Make sure the board type in platformio.ini matches your hardware
(e.g. esp32-s3-devkitc-1 or LilyGO T-Relay S3).
